# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). While the version is
`0.x`, a breaking change bumps the minor and is written up with its migration.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- A URL region now stops at `$`, at a backtick and at an already masked code
  region. Before, `https://x.y$a$` was one `url` region that swallowed the
  formula, and a URL glued to inline code was dropped whole for overlapping
  it. The price: a `$` anywhere in a URL ends the URL there. Text in which
  no `$` or backtick occurs inside a URL masks exactly as before. The formula
  pass now drops a match that overlaps an earlier region, like the code and
  URL passes always did, so the spans stay disjoint when a `$` before a URL
  meets the `$` the URL released.
- `maskProtectedRegions` now returns a `ClassifiedMaskResult`: every span
  carries `kind` (`'code' | 'url' | 'formula' | 'abbreviation'`), the pass that
  painted it. `ClassifiedMaskResult` is a subtype of `MaskResult` — nothing was
  removed and no position changed — so code that reads `start`/`end`, or
  assigns the result to a `MaskResult`, keeps compiling and behaving the same.
  Only an assertion that fixes the exact set of keys on a span (a deep-equality
  check against `{ start, end }`) needs to add `kind`. `maskFormulas` and
  `maskAbbreviationPeriods` are unchanged.

### Added

- Types `ProtectedSpan` and `ClassifiedMaskResult` are exported.
- The tests are now type-checked (`tsconfig.typecheck.json`, run by
  `npm run typecheck`), so a read whose only check is the declared type — such
  as `kind` on a span — fails to compile if the type stops promising it, even
  while the runtime value is still there.
